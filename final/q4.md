# Q4

## Initial Thoughts

The concept of static single assignment form stems from divergent branches that involve the same variable.
So that when these divergent branches converge at basic block the variable can have different values.
So the phi instruction occurs at join points.
Divergent edges, i.e. multiple paths from the same basic block arise from branch instructions.
Unconditional branching is not applicable as only one branch is taken.

## Answer

So, there must be a conditional.
