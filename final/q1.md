# Q1

## Initial Thoughts

If the variable is inside contitional (or nested conditinals) then those conditionals resolve to true otherwise the execution would not reach that point.
Therefore, those conditionals can be removed as they must be true always for that variable at that program point.

Only those conditionals (control dependance) must remain that modify the value of the variable, outside of the final scope of the variable.

## Answer

- Check the type of the basic block at slice criterian

- case if.body:
  - repeat until out of if.body
    - check if this basic block modifies variable (mark this instruction)
    - go to predecessor assume br conditional is always true

Then for other basic blocks we must traverse and keep track of instructions that modify this variable, marking all instructions that contain the variables at the phi instruction definition for slice criterian.
