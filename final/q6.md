## Initial Thoughts

Edges that go to a dead basic block
All successor edges from dead basic blocks

## Answer

### a

Edges that go to a dead basic block.
All successor edges from dead basic blocks.

### b

If a live basic block (a) has a successor that goes through a dead basic block (b) back to a alive basic block (c) then that region will be squashed.
I.e. the region between a and c, all edges will be deleted and a new edge from a to c will be created.
