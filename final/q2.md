# Q2

## Initial Thoughts

If the slice criterion is withen a loop.body and the loop.body contains instruction/s that modify variable then each iteration of the loop will have a different value.

Follow all predecessors recursively, keep list of visited blocks that influence the variable.
Follow all successors recursively, keep list of visited blocks that influence the variable.
If both sets intersection is not the null set we can conclude we are inside a loop that modifies the variable.

This idea can be expanded for nested loops. The scope will only be nested further if there are more basic blocks that are part of a loop body (that can be identified by the above method using a stack of basic blocks) that influence the variable.

## Answer

- Check the type of the basic block

  - loop.body
    - for each instruction in loop.body
      - compute intersection between pred and succ
      - check if slice criterian is modified (mark this instruction)
      - determine scope
      - mark instructions in pred as necessary if scope is in loop.body that modifies variable
