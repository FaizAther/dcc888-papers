# Q5

## Initial Thoughts

```C
int F(int a, int b, int c) {
  x = a;
  while (x < b) {
    x += c * c;
  }
  return x;
}
```

1. Traverse the dependance graph starting with the x.0 node.

2. Visit each predecesor, keep a list of visited nodes.

3. Stop when you reach NULL, or when you reach a visited node again.

4. At the end of a dependance graph see the free variables associated with the phi instruciton of our variable, in this case (a,b,c).

## Answer

### a

1. NULL

2. revisit a node

### b

The backward traversal of the dependance graph shows the 3 variables that are needed by our candidate variable.
